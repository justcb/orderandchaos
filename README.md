# Order and Chaos Proof of Concept June 2022

# Overview
'''
Our project is to create a token-based game that allows players to choose sides and battle on behalf of Order or Chaos. 

The game uses blockchain technology including Solidity, Ethereum ERC-20 Fungible Tokens, and the ERC-721 Nonfungible Tokens. Using these tokens, players will be able to earn OAC tokens as they play. 

This is a growing genre of FinTech, combining gaming with opportunities to earn by playing. 

For the POC, we will create a working model of the game that is deployed on a test network. Our focus here is to establish the backend Fintech blockchain components. Ultimately the goal for the product would be to improve the gameplay to generate revenue by monetizing the game and building the value of the OAC tokens.

Running React on Repl.it
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Vite is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

Getting Started
Hit run
Edit App.jsx and watch it live update!
By default, Replit runs the dev script, but you can configure it by changing the run field in the .replit file.
